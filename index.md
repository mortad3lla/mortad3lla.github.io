## Research Interests
- I am interested in the field of Algebraic Geometry. During my Master in Bologna I studied moduli spaces of curves and surfaces. My PhD project lies in the field of Equivariant Algebraic Geometry, which is the study of Algebraic Varieties under a group action. I am now studying (Equivariant) Motivic Homotopy Theory.
