Hi everyone! I am a mathematician studying in the field of Algebraic Geometry. I recently got interested in Lean 4. In this repository you can find my progress in the study of Lean 4.

In the file 'Exercisex TPL.lean' you can find how I completed the exercises from the book 'Theorem Proving in Lean'.
